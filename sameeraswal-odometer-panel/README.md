# Odometer

Description:
The Grafana Odometer Plugin is a visualization tool designed to display counters in the form of an odometer. It adds a dynamic and engaging element to your Grafana dashboards, making your data come alive as the numbers change in a manner similar to how digits move in a physical meter.

Features:
This plugin offers two distinct types of animations:

1. Odometer Animation:
With the Odometer animation, your numbers will move gracefully, just like the digits in a traditional mechanical meter. This style of animation brings a touch of elegance and nostalgia to your data visualization.

2. Counter Animation:
The Counter animation, on the other hand, simulates the way numbers change in a digital meter. It offers a modern and sleek representation, making your data feel contemporary and cutting-edge.

Installation:
To install this Grafana Odometer Plugin, follow these steps:

1. Download the plugin zip file from [https://github.com/sameeraswal/grafana_plugin_odometer/raw/v1.0.0/sameeraswal-odometer-panel-1.0.0.zip].
2. Extract the contents to your Grafana plugins directory, which is typically located at 'data/plugins' or '/var/lib/grafana/plugins' on a Unix-based system.
3. Restart your Grafana server to activate the plugin.

Usage:
1. After installation, you can add the Odometer visualization to your Grafana dashboard.

2. Create or edit a panel and select the Odometer visualization from the list of available visualizations.

3. Configure the panel settings, including data sources and queries, to display your desired metrics.

4. Customize the animation type to choose between the Odometer and Counter animations.

5. Save the panel configuration, and the Odometer visualization will display your data with the selected animation style.
